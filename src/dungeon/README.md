## Jax!

This is a demo developed using the Jax WebGL framework (http://github.com/sinisterchipmunk/jax). The core of the demo
took about an hour to write; it took me more time to debug the arched ceilings. A simple cube-shaped dungeon would have been much easier, but wouldn't have come out looking nearly as nice.

## Controls

Use W/S/A/D or up/down/left/right to move forward/backward/strafe left/strafe right. Use the mouse to turn.

## Features

This demo showcases the following features:

  * texturing
  * normal (bump) mapping
  * multiple light sources
  * keyboard/mouse input handling
  * collision detection
  * 3D models (torches) exported from Blender
  * Dynamic torch fire effects
  * Particles
